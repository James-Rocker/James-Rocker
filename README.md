### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is James and I am a Data and Software Engineer in the UK. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on - improving some of my old code I've committed, adding additional python solutions to my portfolio, but usually corporate projects. 

ðŸ“– Knowledge: Python, Docker, Terrafrom, AWS, Airflow, Data modelling, SQL (of various versions), Ruby, Kafka

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - Rust, async coding and building software that scales. Also some MLOps

âš¡ Fun fact: I mainly code in Python as a data engineer however I will not be able to make it if I have to keep reading bad data science code structures. Also I have 2 cats
