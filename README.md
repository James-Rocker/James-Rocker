### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is James and I am a Data Engineer in Milton Keynes - UK. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on - improving some of my old code, adding additional python solutions because I don't get to use it very often and adding some use cases of docker

ðŸ“– Knowledge: Python, Docker, Kafka, data modelling, SQL, Airflow, Power BI, ruby

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - more about eventification, agile and I would like to start coding in Rust or Go

âš¡ Fun fact: I mainly code in python as a data engineer however I'm interested in etymology, yugioh and animals
