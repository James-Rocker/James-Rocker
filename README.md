### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is James and I am a senior data and software engineer in the UK. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on - improving some of my old code I've committed, adding additional python solutions to my portfolio, but usually corporate projects. If stuff looks a little amateurish, it's because I rarely code in my free time.

ðŸ“– Knowledge: Python, Docker, Terrafrom, AWS, Airflow, Data modelling, SQL (of various versions), Ruby, Kafka, Rust

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - Async coding in rust and Streamlit + front end design. Also some MLOps

âš¡ Fun fact: I have 2 cats and I'm utterly paranoid writing anything more here might help someone crack a password even slightly better
